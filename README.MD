# aura-range
Applies a visual effect on party members that are out of range for auras.

## Info
- The current visual effect is Kelsaik's Ice debuff. Party members glow bright white-blue when out of range. (Probably not ideal, share if you know a more suitable alternative).
- Does not compensate for buffed range (Harrowhold)

## Usage
